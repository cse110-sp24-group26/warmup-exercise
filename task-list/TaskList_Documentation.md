# Task List Documentation

## Purpose/Overview

**Intro:** This is a simple task list widget that allows you to create separate lists with tasks under each list.
Each task has its own description and due date that can be initialized through user input.
This task listsâ€™ main functionality is to jot down, categorize, and remind us of our important tasks with their due dates and details.
This enables us to worry less about trying to remember every task that is needed to be done in our lives.
It also helps organize our thoughts visually to most effectively map out which tasks need to be prioritized.
