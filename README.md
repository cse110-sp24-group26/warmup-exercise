# Warmup Exercise

We have three folders relating to the three distinct tasks. More documentation can be found in each of the respective folders.
## [Sentiment](https://cse110-sp24-group26.github.io/warmup-exercise/sentiment/)
The sentiment rating uses html, javascript, and css to display a selection of emotions that you can choose from. The selected value is dynamically updated
## [Task List](https://cse110-sp24-group26.github.io/warmup-exercise/task-list/)
The task list widget dynamically generates a list of tasks using javascript, given from a provided json file.
## [Calendar](https://cse110-sp24-group26.github.io/warmup-exercise/calendar/)
The calendar widget is customizable and uses native web components to display a list of days that can each be clicked on.
