# Sentiment Widget Documentation
Using the sentiment widget is very simple. Simply open up the HTML file in a web browser, which will also load the CSS and JavaScript for the widget. Then, hover your mouse over any one of the emojis and click down to select the rating. Rating can be changed by clicking on a different sentiment emoji. The rating selected is stated below the emoji selection panel.
